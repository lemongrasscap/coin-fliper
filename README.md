# coin-fliper


i wrote this in 40 minutes for fun.
im not good at coding.
but if you like it then im happy d:

flips a coin however many times you
want and tells you how many in a row 
of heads/tails you got.

edit line 19 
(	#print("random number : ",binary_choise)) 
and get rid of the comment (#) to see the 
coin outputs in real time.


i recomend runing it through cmd by doing
'python filename/coin-fliper/main.py'
idk why but runing it from sublime txt 3
just didnt do anything. hope you 
enjoy messing with this :)


more might come soon if i get bored
